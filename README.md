# CNN MODEL
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste into different categories for efficient waste management. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various waste types, such as plastic, metal, organic, and paper. By leveraging feature extraction and deep learning, the CNN automates waste sorting, promoting eco-friendly disposal and recycling.
